This is a visualization of the 2011 CrossFit games. The data was obtained from: http://xfit2011.blogspot.com/ I cannot thank those guys enough for open sourcing the .csv file with all of the data. The final data used for this visualization is a cleaned version of the .csv in the form of an sqlite database. This app is open source so please feel free to fork the repository. I hope this visualization will help shed light on certain exercises. For example, in 11.4 you can see that there is a normal distribution based on weight, which makes sense being that the workout is burpees and muscle ups. Finally, neither this application nor myself is associated with CrossFit. Just a fan.
